## Restaurant app

This is a project from Front End Developer students Herman Bystr√∂m, Lisa Sundberg, Omi Gibba and Jimmy Wongprom.

It is a webpage with a booking system for the fictional restaurant Nano Food.

Our goal with this assignment was to practice the different techniques and languages that we have learned this past year.

The application is built with PHP, React and MySQL.
